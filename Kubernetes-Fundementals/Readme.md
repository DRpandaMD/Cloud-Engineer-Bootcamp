This is intended to be a *learning* aid.  Material here is either directly source from Linux Foundation Training or paraphrased or my own personal input. (Depending on topic and my own personal experience).  This also serves a personal consolidated reference as I take notes and go over labs and figure out what worked and what didn't work for me.  Please use at your own discretion.
