# Package Management Systems

[Home](/README.md)

## Software Packaging Concepts

Package managers are not a new concept to me but here are some basics about them:

* Gather and compress associated software files into a single package (archive), which may require one or more other packages to be installed first.

* Allow for easy software installation or removal.​

* Can verify file integrity via an internal database.​

* Can authenticate the origin of packages.​

* Facilitate upgrades.​

* Group packages by logical features.​

* Manage dependencies between packages.

## Why use packages

* Automation: no manual install and upgrades

* scalability: install on one or many systems, through scripting and automation

* repeatability and predictability

* security and auditing
