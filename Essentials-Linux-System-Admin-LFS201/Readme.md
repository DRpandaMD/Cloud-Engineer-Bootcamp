# Essentials for a Linux System Admin

There are some other topics which are necessary for system administrators to be knowledgeable about, that we will not cover in this course. In particular:

* Text editors (vi, emacs, nano, gedit, etc.)
* Finding Linux documentation (getting help)
* Manipulating text (sed, grep, awk, cut, paste, tail, head, etc.)
* File utilities (find, locate, file, etc.)
* Printing (configuring printers, managing print jobs)
* Graphical interfaces and their administration
* bash shell scripting
* System installation.
