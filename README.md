# Cloud-Engineer-Bootcamp

My repo and notes for the Linux Foundation Cloud Engineer Bootcamp

Most of the information in here is sourced from the hardworking people at the Linux Foundation

I will include additional stuff that I found useful and personal dialoge with my owne personal experience while go through this course.

This will NOT have everything they provided in it.

This is just to be used as a study aid for myself and whom everelse finds this type of centralized, with commentary helpful.
